Project Name: sphere.java

Introduction:
  - Problem Statement: Write a program that takes the radius of a sphere (a floating point number) as input and outputs the sphere's diameter, 
  circumference, surface area, and volume. Add comments to your program.
  - Project Purpose: To learn how to do basic programming ideas in java, such as print statements and calculations. Another purpose of the project is to improve coding skills that are necessary for future coding classes, such as Software Enginnering.

Methodology:
- Step 1: Declare Variables: In order for the code to run properly, there needs to be variables for the radius, diameter, circumference, surface area, as well as the volume. All of these variables are floats. Lastly, import the scanner in order to get input from the user for step 2.
- Step 2: Prompt User and Get Input: I prompted input from the user by using a System.out.println statement and asking the user to enter the radius value. Then I used nextFloat() in order to assure that the radius value is recognized by the scanner.
- Step 3: Calculations: I created four calculation formulas for diameter, circumference, surface area, as well as volume. The formula for diameter of a sphere is 2 * radius. The formula for circumference of a sphere is 2 * 3.14159f * radius. The formula for surface area of a sphere is 4 * 3.14159f * radius * radius. Lastly, the formula for volume of a sphere is (4/3) * 3.14159f * radius * radius * radius.
- Step 4: Print Results:  For the final step, I printed the results for the diameter, circumference, surface_area, and volume values by using four System.out.println statements.

Results:
- The code ran successfully due to my code having no bugs. The program sucessfully calculated the diameter, circumference, surface area, and volume of a sphere.

Conclusions:
- I learned how to do basic programming foundations on my own in a new coding language. Previously, I have learned how to do similar projects in python and c++; however, I can now do the same in a new language which will only improve my coding skills. These skills helped me complete harder projects in java using new coding concepts in java, such as StringBuilder and toString.
- In order to improve my program, I think finding new values of new shapes could be great additions. New values for new shapes could include the diameter of a circle, or area of a square.
